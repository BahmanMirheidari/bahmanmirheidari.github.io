I am a Research Fellow in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs) at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk), and a member of the [Speech and Hearing (SpandH) group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs/research/groups/spandh). I have been working with [Professor Heidi Christensen](https://heidi-christensen.github.io/website) over six years after my PhD. My research interests include medial applications of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) (e.g. people with dementia, stroke, and/or other mental disorders), automatic analysis of conversation, speaker diarisation, and tracking speech and language changes over time, automatic Tuberculosis (TB) detection, and automatic emotion/mood/anxiety detection through analysis of speech.
