I am a Research Fellow in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs) at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk) and a member of the [Speech and Hearing (SpandH) group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs/research/groups/spandh)). I worked with [Professor Heidi Christensen](https://heidi-christensen.github.io/website) for over six years after my PhD. My research interests include medical applications of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) (e.g. people with dementia, stroke, and other mental disorders), automatic analysis of conversation, speaker diarization, and tracking speech and language changes over time, automatic Tuberculosis (TB) detection, and automatic emotion/mood/anxiety detection through analysis of speech.
